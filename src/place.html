The people of Hawassa were also very welcoming and friendly. I was always greeted with a smile, and everyone was eager to share their culture with me.

The surrounding scenery is simply breathtaking, with towering mountains and lush vegetation providing a picturesque backdrop. But what really sets Sodere Resort apart is its abundance of wildlife.
